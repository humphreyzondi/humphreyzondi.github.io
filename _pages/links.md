## Software

* * *

[A short note](/largedatastata) with some tips I've put together for working with "large" datasets in Stata, which links to other resources.

[Stata2R](https://stata2r.github.io/) provide a very helpful introduction to `data.table` and `fixest` in R, primarily designed for Stata users.  

[Grant McDermott's](https://grantmcdermott.com/) [Data Science for Economists](https://github.com/uo-ec510-2020-spring/lectures) course is an excellent introduction to tools such as Git and tasks such as webscraping.

## Data

* * *

The single best source for South African microdata is the [DataFirst Data Portal](https://datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/central).

* * *

[Statistics South Africa](https://www.statssa.gov.za/) collects and produces an invaluable array of South African data.
Unfortunately their website can be difficult to navigate. A few particularly useful pages:
* [Historic CPI series](http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0141/CPIHistory.pdf?), [CPI archive](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=P0141&SCH=73033), [PPI archive](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=P0142.1&SCH=73035)
* ['Interactive data' webpage](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1417), which links to the Nesstar interface for downloading microdata, and to economic time series in machine-readable formats.
* [QLFS](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=P0211&SCH=73289), [QES](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1854&PPN=P0277&SCH=72995) and [GDP](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=P0441&SCH=72934) archives
* Archives of various monthly series, mainly production and sales data: 
  [Mining](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=P2041&SCH=73088), [Manufacturing](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=P3041.2&SCH=73089), [Electricity](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=P4141&SCH=73090), 
  [Retail trade](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=P6242.1&SCH=72671), [Wholesale trade](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=P6141.2&SCH=72672),
  [Food and beverages](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=P6420&SCH=73109), [Motor trade](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=P6343.2&SCH=73105), 
  [Tourist accomodation](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=P6410&SCH=72889), [Tourism and Migration](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=P0351&SCH=73296), [Import/Export Unit Value Indices](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=P0142.7&SCH=73049)
* [Input-output](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=Report-04-04-02&SCH=7002) (see also [here](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1854&PPN=D0404.1) and [here](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1854&PPN=D0404)) and [Supply and use](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=Report-04-04-03&SCH=73278) (see [here](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1866&PPN=Report-04-04-01&SCH=4764) for 1998-2005) tables

[Catalogue of public data sources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asrQMHp_aJrD-LqkmW9n5yLT6Cm-K1geBEn9nLfYb3E/edit#gid=388540894) courtesy of [Open Data South Africa](https://opendataza.gitbook.io/toolkit/).
Their website, with data organised by theme, is easier to navigate than the (overwhelming) catalogue.

* * *

South African COVID-19 data:
* [Machine-readable South African COVID-19 data](https://github.com/dsfsi/covid19za), from the [Data Science for Social Impact](https://dsfsi.github.io/) group at the Unversity of Pretoria.
* The [NICD](https://www.nicd.ac.za/) is the definitive source for SA COVID-19 data, but last I checked most of their data were trapped inside PDFs.

* * *

Data on electricity supply/generation and load shedding (rolling blackouts) in South Africa:
* [Load shedding data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZpX_twP8sFBOAU6t--Vvh1pWMYSvs60UXINuD5n-K08/edit#gid=863218371) from [EskomSePush](https://sepush.co.za/).
* [Detailed Eskom monthly plant-level energy availability factors (EAF)](https://amabhungane.org/stories/220928-the-collapse-of-old-king-coal/) (see the "Evidence docket" link) provided by [amaBhungane](https://amabhungane.org/).
* The [Eskom Data Portal](https://www.eskom.co.za/dataportal/) provides a wide array of detailed time series data. Use the (automated) "Data request form". 

* * *

Geospatial data:
* If you're working with South African census data, [Adrian Frith](https://adrian.frith.dev/)'s census mapping [website](https://census2011.adrianfrith.com/) is very useful.  
* The SALDRU [YouthExplorer](https://www.youthexplorer.org.za/) is also a very useful source for geolocated South African data. Apart from youth-focused socio-economic statistics, it also provides downloadable point data for the coordinates of "service points" such as schools, police stations, post offices, healthcare facilities, SASSA offices, and a variety of other facilities.  
* South African police station coordinates with their boundaries are available from [SAPS](https://www.saps.gov.za/services/boundary.php).
* The [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home) is a definitive source of weather data.
* [The Gridded Population of the World (GPW)](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4) data from [SEDAC](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/) is very useful if you need the spatial distribution of human population across a continuous raster surface, rather than one defined by administrative boundaries.
